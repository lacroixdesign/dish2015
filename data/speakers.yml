  bio: >
       <p>A Tennessee native, Sasha began making silkscreen posters for Memphis' independent music scene in 2001, while earning a degree in printmaking at the University. The posters paved the way for new design clients locally and nationally, and led to a myriad of experiences and growth in the freelance design and illustration world. A year after graduating from the University, he relocated to Seattle, WA in 2007 for a change of scenery and new opportunities. He lucked his way in to the art department of Sub Pop Records, where he has been since. When not toiling away with albums and other label goods, he finds some time for Amigos Skateboards, a skateboard company he art directs and co-owns with a group of friends, and the occasional freelance or poster gig. He has fallen for the Northwest, but deeply misses the South.</p>
